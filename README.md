# MyFaceCards

## Overview
Each eponymous function takes in the parameter 'name' which searches the MATLAB project for a .jpg matching the name used for the parameter: the kings.m function then converts the four kings into look-a-likes of the person, the queens.m does the same for the four queens, and jacks.m for the jacks.
The function works optimally when the image is resized to a ratio of 112x92 pixels, so this is the purpose of the resize.m function.

### See Issues for examples of real conversions as well as printed prototypes!
